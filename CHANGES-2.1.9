Changes in ruby-openid 2.1.9

* added Gemfile and Rakefile. Tests are easily run with
  $ rake test

* Renamed the gemspec file and fixed a deprecation warning about "SPEC"

* restructured the test directory to match current practices

* fixed SEGFAULT in lib/openid/dh.rb running in Ruby 1.9.2-290

* fixed bugs in lib/openid/yadis/xrires.rb. Tests were failing.

* fixed problem in Rails 3 with example consumer code handing Rails path_parameters to Consumer.complete
  examples/rails_openid/app/controllers/consumer_controller.rb
  Existing clients migrating to Rails 3 need to match this change:
    parameters = params.reject{ |k,v| request.path_parameters[k.to_sym] } # params keys are String; path_parameters keys are Symbol
